# FORTRAN-code-written
Previous code I have written in the FORTRAN language. The aim of the repository is to provide some examples of previous work and the level of experience I have had with writing in this language by showing code I have written for some previous projects. In cases where there are specific instructions for completion of any of the files in this repository, I have included instructions below.

1. Name of Project: Random Number Generator
Desc: program generates various pseudo-random numbers series in different distributions (Normalized,Gaussian).

Special Compilation instructions: None

2. Name of Project: Heat equation
Desc: Program models the heat equation, looking at heat diffusion in two cases (1D ring, 1D bar) through the use of Forward time centric and Backwards time centric numerical solvers in periodic and dirichlet boundary conditions.

Special Compilation instructions:  Heat_equation_PBC.f95 program needs to be compiled with FTCS_BTCS_solver.f95 module

3. Name of Project: Signal Processing
Desc: provides discrete fourier transformation signal process in a number of cases (sine wave, rectangular, triangular, and gaussian pulses) with the opportunity of using various windowing functions on the signal (triangular, cosine, gaussian).

Special Compilation instructions: None. Data generated by program can be graphed easily by running the accompanying python program, DFT_graphs.py
