# FORTRAN-code-written
Previous code I have written in the FORTRAN language. The aim of the repositiory is to provide some examples of previous work and the level of experience I have had with writing in this language by showing code I have written for some previous projects. In cases where there are specifcic instrustions for complation of any of the files in this reposiitory, I have included instructions below.

1. Name of Project: Random Number Generator
Desc: program generates various psedo-random numbers series in different distributions (Normalized,Gaussian).

Special Compilation instructions: None

2. Name of Project: Heat equation
Desc: Program models the heat equation, looking at heat diffusion in two cases (1D ring, 1D bar) through the use of Forward time centric and Backwards time centric numberical solvers in periodic and direchclet boundry conditions. 

Special Compilation instructions:  Heat_equation_PBC.f95 program needs to be compiled with FTCS_BTCS_solver.f95 module

3. Name of Project: Signal Processing
Desc: provides discrete fourier transformation signal process in a number of cases (sine wave, triangular,  

Special Compilation instructions: None. Data generated by program can be graphed easly by running the accompnying python program, DFT_graphs.py .
